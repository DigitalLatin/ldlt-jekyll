## MAA Editions

Three editions have been peer reviewed and published with the imprimatur of the Medieval Academy of America. Owing to the special requirements of those editions, the online versions of the editions are not available on this site, but they are available in the viewer provided by the [Lombard Press](https://lombardpress.org/).
