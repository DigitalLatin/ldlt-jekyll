# About the Library of Digital Latin Texts

The LDLT aims to publish high-quality, critical editions of Latin texts
from all eras. Editions are published as [TEI
XML](http://www.tei-c.org/) files encoded according to our
[guidelines](https://digitallatin.github.io/guidelines/LDLT-Guidelines.html).
Those files are stored in a version-controlled repository, and they are
openly available under a Creative Commons license.

Central to our philosophy is the idea that interfaces are a form of
scholarship entirely different from textual criticism. Textual scholars
should not have to master the scholarly fields of human computer
interaction and data visualization to publish a digital edition. Rather,
the data for critical editions should be openly available for scholars
in those fields to use in making arguments about the text from their
perspective.

Nevertheless, so that users may read and interact with LDLT texts, we
have made a standard interface available on this site. The interface is
itself an implementation of
[CETEIcean](https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean), a research project of
Hugh Cayless and Raffaele Viglianti. The interface provides a basic
navigation menu; an interactive apparatus criticus that allows dynamic
swapping of variant readings into and out of the main text; filters for
types of variants; and dynamically generated lexical and morphological
analysis, courtesy of the [Alpheios project](https://alpheios.net/).
